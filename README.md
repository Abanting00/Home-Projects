Projects I created in my free time

Project 1 - testing and learing pygame library by creating an animation of a monitor screen that shows a bunch of different animation 
including a block that bounces off the screen and changes the its color and a snow fall animation. The animation that are portrayed in
the screen changes if the user pressed any key.

Project 2 - Testing out Sprite by creating a block collision game. The goal of the game is for the user to collect all the falling blocks
using keyboards to control the block.

Project 3 - A spin of the Space Invader game. The goal of the game is to get rid of all the bouncing block and ball by shooting at them.
